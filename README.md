Hi! This is just a simple 4x4 number sliding puzzle created in Java that I made for fun :) 

The goal of the game is simple! Sort the tiles in ascending order!

# How to run and play the game:
1. Make sure `Java` is downloaded
2. Clone `15Puzzle` on your laptop
3. Go to the `15Puzzle` directory on your terminal
4. Run `$ javac src/numberSortPuzzle.java` and then `$ java src/numberSortPuzzle.java` to start playing!
5. In order to move tiles, simply type the number associated to the tile you want to move on the terminal.


## Future Enhancements to be made to this project:
- Create a UI for this game so that it can be played outside of the terminal
- Customizable size for number slider game
